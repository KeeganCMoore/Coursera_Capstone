DUBLIN HOUSE PRICING ANALYSIS

This is the second entry in the 'Decoding Dublin through Data' Capstone project and analyses the pricing of property around Dublin, 
including the avreage prices per area.

DATA:
- 'Dublin_House_Price_PSRA.xlsx' : This is the the publicly available housing data published by the PSRA on 
https://data.gov.ie/dataset/property-price-register but has been neatened and filtered for my analysis
- 'Lat_Long.xlsx' : This is the matching Latitudes and Longitudes for the Dublin house pricing data. It has been included for simplicity
as Geocoding every address for > 3000 properties will take a substantial amount of time and often times out.
